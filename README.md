## Project Description

Feed Me is an app designed to connect food establishments with surplus food to individuals or organizations in need. The aim is to reduce food waste and promote sustainability.

## Team

- **Joel Yahaya** - Project Manager and Full-Stack Developer
  - Responsible for overall project coordination, planning, and communication.
  - Manages backend and frontend development, including database design and user interface implementation.

## Technologies

- **Backend:** Python with Flask framework
- **Database:** SQL (SQLite for development)
- **Frontend:** Reactjs
- **Additional Tools:** Plain HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## Architecture

- **Backend:** 
  - Python with Flask for server-side logic and database interactions.
  - SQLite for development (potential for other SQL databases in production).
- **Frontend:** 
  - Reactjs for building a component-based user interface.
  - Plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for simplicity and ease of implementation.

## Development Report

### Successes
- Successful integration of backend and frontend using Flask and React.
- Efficient database design and implementation.
- User-friendly interface development.

### Challenges
- Database scalability issues.
- Encouraging adoption from food establishments and users.

### Areas for Improvement
- Enhanced database indexing and potential database sharding.
- Improved outreach and awareness campaigns.

### Lessons Learned
- Importance of scalable architecture.
- Necessity of user feedback for continuous improvement.

## Next Steps

- Implement advanced data analytics for better insights.
- Expand outreach programs to increase platform adoption.
- Continuously gather and incorporate user feedback.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
